# Custom Color Palette Generator from Images

## Repository
https://github.com/izzyvigg/ANGM2305-Final-Project-Proposal.git

## Description
This project will allow user's to paste images and color-pick pixels to create their own color palettes. Current tools that are
similar limit users' customization - to solve this issue, this project will grant further freedom in the number of images one can 
eyedrop from, the number of color swatches, and allow users to make several color palettes side-by-side for comparison. 

## Features
- pasting and displaying multiple images
	- Short explaination of how it will be executed.
- color picker tool (aka eyedropper)
	- Short explaination of how it will be executed.
- side-by-side palette comparison 
	- Short explaination of how it will be executed.
- custom color swatch amount
    - Short explaination of how it will be executed.
- exporting results as jpgs or pngs
    - Short explaination of how it will be executed.

## Challenges
- how to zoom in on a specific part of an image when a user's cursor hovers over it.
- UI design that is easy to understand and appealing for users.
- since I want multiple palettes, I need to make sure only one palette is active at a time while the user is color picking 
  (and make it obvious which is active to prevent confusion).

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- The ideal outcome would be a fully functional program with all features enabled without bugs.

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- The bare essentials for a good outcome would be at least the multiple images, eyedropper tool, one color palette, and one export option all working.
